## Install Leiningen 2.X on Ubuntu
It seems that Leiningen along with apt repository sticks to the version 1.7, which is released 2 years ago.
 
To install the latest version of Leiningen 2.X you need to do it manually. The steps are 
 
- Download the [script](https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein) from Leiningen github.
- Run it for one time, it will download the latest version.
- Put the file somewhere in your PATH so that you can run it naturally.Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below :point_down:).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
