## Install Leiningen 2.X on Ubuntu
It seems that Leiningen along with apt repository sticks to the version 1.7, which is released 2 years ago.

To install the latest version of Leiningen 2.X you need to do it manually. The steps are 

- Download the [script](https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein) from Leiningen github.
- Run it for one time, it will download the latest version.
- Put the file somewhere in your PATH so that you can run it naturally.
