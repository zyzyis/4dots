At the beginning of the year I was improving my problem solving skills by cracking the [Leetcode](http://www.leetcode.com) problem set. It was a fun experience and I invested around 2 months night time to solve all the problems 2 ~ 3 times. In the end I wrote a solution blog with all my source code on Github. 

Interested? it is [here](https://github.com/zyzyis/leetcode).

My suggestion of improving problem solving skills like cracking Leetcode is to do it 2 - 3 times. It is not enough to solve it for the sake of just solving it, instead you need to find the best solution available, either through yourself, your friends, or get it from Internet.
